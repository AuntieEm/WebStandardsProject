        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Emily! I'm more than just a student. I'm a girlfriend, a daughter, a pet owner, a business owner and a hard worker. I'm an independent learner and enjoy learning new things but I also really enjoy curling up with my puppy, Otis and chilling out with some Netflix.
            I'm also an artist. Art is my life. I also really like computers. I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none.</p>

            <h2>Drop-Down Menu Header</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
            <p>A header is a crucial element to a website. Getting it to sit on the page and function properly is even more crucial.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn.</h3>
            <p>Having a header tool bar with drop-down elements makes a website even more useful by providing more links for the user to click
                and allow them to get more specific with what they are looking for without having to use a search bar.</p>

            <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
            <p>I want to figure out how actually get a search box to work. The few times I've used it, I had a terrible time trying to figure it out and it never actually worked.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn.</h3>
            <p>The search box will help me with functions and learning how to get the find function to work based on what the user types in. As well as creating libraries of searches to aid the user in finding what they need.</p>

            <h3>What I hope to practice/learn?</h3>
            <p>I hope to learn how to get responsiveness to work properly when sizing down windows and to get all the elements to behave when I do so. Like when it takes a horizontal list of elements and converts them to a vertical list for smaller windows.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn.</h3>
            <p>This feature will aid the user in using my site on any platform and device. As well as just resizing it on a larger screen so as to fit multiple windows on the screen.</p>
